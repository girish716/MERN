# This is complete MERN app

current project uses Manogo DB to store data, Node js for backend leveraging Express JS and React JS for front end.

## Task Manager

By using this app user can manage his/her daily tasks. My main concentration while developing the app is to understand CRUD operations in React and Mongo DB.

### `Features`

1. By clicking on add button, user can add the task by providing description in the input.
2. once tasks are added, user can delete & update the task.
3. while updating the task, user will have option to make the task completed.
4. If the task is completed, a task completed icon will be displayed to the left the task item, so that user users can easily identify completed tasks.
